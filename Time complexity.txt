#Time Complexity and space Complexity
=>Time complexity:
1.Best Case=>omega(1)
2.Averge Case=>Theta((n+1)/2)
3.Wrost Case=>O(n), We can take this case in the all coding problems

=>if we are taking two nested loop(Like we are taking i and the j loop in the code) in the code then we can take time complexity is O(n^2)
=>if we are taking single loop in the code we are taking time comlexity is O(n+m)
Compare | O(n)          || O(n^2)         |||           O(n^3)
        |2 unit of Time || 4 Unit of time ||| 8 unit of time

=>so we can take with the best of the code of timing is a O(n) is coparison to other
=>So the summary is we can take minimum time complexity to run the any code


=>Space Complexity
=>Space complexity means how much memory take in the storage like how many variables in the code 
=>Less Space its means the code is nice
=>Less Time Complexity its means the code is nice
